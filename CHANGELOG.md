## Future Considerations

### Potential Features (Not Yet Implemented)
- Volume controls for each player
- Visual progress bars showing playback position
- Playlist functionality
- Audio file selection from device storage
- Playback speed controls
- Audio visualization
- Background playback support

### Known Limitations
- Currently uses static audio files only
- No error handling for missing audio files
- No loading states during audio initialization
- Limited to two players (easily expandable)
